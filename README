The contents of this folder will be used to install AvesTerra on the ATra
test server, or really any RedHat/derivative machine.

The "setup-environment.bash" script is used to install the server's dependencies,
setup the directory structure, place the executables where they should go, and put
the config files in their proper places; the provided config files are "NOT FINAL",
and will definitely change before the test run.

The "setup-avesterra.bash" script should only be run after the "setup-environment.bash"
has successfully completed; this script depends on the directory structure, executables,
existence of config files, and the proper version of WolfSSL to be installed

The "start-atra.bash/stop-atra.bash" are simply scripts that start/stop
systemd services, which will be associated with AvesTerra executables
and ATra executables.

Also, feel free to edit the ATerra/Services files to your liking, just
don't modify the executable paths.

NOTE: This script assumes that your certificates are in the directory $HOME/Certificates; if you are storing the Certificates
elsewhere, then update the AVESTERRA_CERT_KEY_DIR_PATH variable, in the setup-environment.bash
 file, to have the absolute path to where you are storing the certificates(avesterra.pem/server.pem)/key(server.key).
