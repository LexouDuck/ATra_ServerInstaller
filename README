The contents of this folder will be used to install AvesTerra on the ATra
test server, or really any RedHat/derivative machine.

The "setup-environment.bash" script is used to install the server's dependencies,
setup the directory structure, place the executables where they should go, setup systemd services,
and enable said system services on boot.  This script is also responsible for copying the certificates
and keys into the /AvesTerra/Certificates folder, from a given source directory.  This measure
was added, to help combat the risk of deleting the original certificates or keys, just in case
the entire /AvesTerra directory was deleted.

The "start-atra.bash/stop-atra.bash" are simply scripts that start/stop
systemd services, which will be associated with AvesTerra executables
and ATra executables.

Also, feel free to edit the ATerra/Services files to your liking, just
don't modify the executable paths.  I modified the service files to make them more of
what you(Luke) wanted, such as running the executables as the user atra.

NOTE: This script assumes that your certificates are in the directory $HOME/Certificates; if you are storing the Certificates
elsewhere, then update the AVESTERRA_CERT_KEY_DIR_PATH variable to reflect where your certificates are located.
